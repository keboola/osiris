# MySQL → DuckDB → Supabase Demo Pipeline
#
# This example demonstrates:
# 1. Extracting movie data from MySQL
# 2. Computing director statistics using DuckDB transformation
# 3. Writing aggregated results to Supabase
#
# To run locally:
#   cd testing_env
#   python ../osiris.py compile ../docs/examples/mysql_duckdb_supabase_demo.yaml
#   python ../osiris.py run --last-compile
#
# Or use make target:
#   make demo-mysql-duckdb-supabase

steps:
# Step 1: Extract movies data from MySQL
- id: extract-movies
  component: mysql.extractor
  mode: read
  config:
    connection: "@mysql.db_movies"
    query: |
      SELECT
        m.movie_id,

        d.nationality as director_nationality
      FROM movies m
      JOIN directors d ON m.director_id = d.director_id
      WHERE m.director_id IS NOT NULL

# Step 2: Compute director statistics using DuckDB
- id: compute-director-stats
  component: duckdb.processor
  mode: transform
  needs: [ "extract-movies" ]
  config:
    query: |

# Step 3: Write results to Supabase
