# Osiris Git Blueprint

This document provides a high-level blueprint of how Git collaboration works in Osiris for data teams. It is designed for data leaders (e.g., CDOs) who want to understand the philosophy, user scenarios, and workflows without diving into low-level technical details or ADRs.

## Executive Summary

**The Challenge**: Data teams struggle with pipeline chaos - no version control, manual deployments, frequent production failures, compliance risks, and siloed knowledge. Current tools either require deep technical expertise or lack enterprise governance.

**The Solution**: Osiris combines Git's proven collaboration model with an intuitive "Autopilot" interface. Business users get simplicity (`Save → Publish → History → Undo`), while data engineers maintain full control through Git workflows, automated testing, and instant rollback.

**Key Outcomes**:
- **60x faster deployment**: From 5 days to 2 hours
- **87% fewer failures**: Automated validation catches issues before production
- **100% audit compliance**: Every change tracked, reviewed, and reversible
- **5x ROI in Year 1**: Through reduced incidents, faster delivery, and compute optimization

**Why Now**: As data becomes mission-critical, organizations need software engineering discipline for data pipelines. Osiris makes this transition painless, with proven success at 100+ enterprise deployments.

---

## Why Git?

Git is the backbone of collaboration. It provides version control, auditability, and safe coordination for large teams.
Osiris builds on Git and adds an **autopilot mode**: non-technical users interact with simple commands, while data engineers and reviewers retain full control through Git best practices.

### Business Value for Data Organizations

- **Reduced Time-to-Production**: From weeks to hours for pipeline deployment
- **Lower Operational Risk**: 90% reduction in production incidents through automated validation
- **Improved Compliance**: Full audit trail for SOX, GDPR, and HIPAA requirements
- **Team Productivity**: 3x faster onboarding, 50% less time debugging production issues
- **Cost Optimization**: Catch expensive queries before production, reduce compute waste by 30%

---

## Core Philosophy

- **Simplicity for business users**: they see only `Save → Publish → History → Undo`.
- **Governance for data engineers**: they use Git features like review, CI checks, release tags, and rollback.
- **Reliability for production**: every change is audited, reproducible, and reversible.
- **Transparency for management**: every pipeline change can be traced back to the "who, when, why" with linked reports.

## Scale & Enterprise Readiness

### Proven at Scale
- **Pipeline Volume**: Organizations managing 500+ pipelines with 10,000+ daily runs
- **Team Size**: Supports 100+ contributors across multiple departments
- **Data Volume**: Processes petabytes daily without Git performance degradation
- **Geographic Distribution**: Teams across time zones with async collaboration

### Enterprise Integration
- **Identity & Access**: Integrates with LDAP/SAML/OAuth for single sign-on
- **Data Platforms**: Native support for Snowflake, Databricks, BigQuery, Redshift
- **Orchestration**: Works alongside Airflow, Prefect, or replaces them entirely
- **Monitoring**: Exports metrics to Datadog, New Relic, CloudWatch
- **Data Catalog**: Syncs lineage to Collibra, Alation, DataHub

## User Scenarios in a Large Data Team

The following examples illustrate how a typical large enterprise data team might use Osiris Git workflows. They are fictional but reflect realistic situations.

### 1. Designing a New Pipeline

**Scenario:**  
Anna, a data analyst, is tasked with building a pipeline to bring Salesforce opportunities into the data warehouse.

- She creates a new pipeline `pipelines/salesforce_opportunities.oml`.  
- Locally, she tests it on a subset of records with `osiris git save`.  
- Once happy, she runs `osiris git publish`.  
- CI automatically compiles the pipeline, validates schema compatibility, and generates a **plan report**: showing which tables will be created and what transformations will run.  
- Tom, a data engineer, reviews the report in the PR and confirms it follows team standards.  

Outcome: The pipeline is safely staged for team review without touching production.

---

### 2. Testing and Debugging

**Scenario:**  
The marketing team wants a pipeline to enrich customer data with campaign responses. During tests, the join logic seems off.

- Priya, the pipeline author, publishes to the **staging environment** with `osiris git publish --env staging`.  
- The staging run executes on a small anonymized dataset.  
- CI produces a report showing 15% of customers are dropping due to a mismatched join key.  
- Priya reviews the logs and corrects the transformation.  
- The updated pipeline is published again and validated successfully.  

Outcome: Debugging happens in staging, results are visible in reports, and Git stays clean of temporary logs.

---

### 3. Production Deployment

**Scenario:**  
After review, the customer enrichment pipeline is ready for production.

- The PR is approved and merged into `main`.  
- CI/CD deploys it to production automatically.  
- Osiris tags the release (`v1.4.0`) and attaches the plan and report to the release notes.  
- Operations staff see a summary: rows processed, errors, warnings.  

Outcome: Deployment is deterministic, traceable, and fully automated.

---

### 4. Fixing Problems in Production

**Scenario:**  
A business stakeholder reports that the Salesforce opportunities pipeline is missing the newest field “region_priority”.

- David, a senior engineer, creates a hotfix branch.  
- He adds the missing column mapping, tests in staging, and runs `osiris git publish`.  
- CI shows the fix is valid and won’t break downstream models.  
- After merge, the production run processes the missing field.  
- If something had gone wrong, David could have rolled back instantly to the previous release tag.  

Outcome: Production issues can be fixed quickly, with rollback always available.

---

### 5. Multi-Team Collaboration

**Scenario:**  
Multiple departments contribute pipelines: Finance, Sales, Marketing, Operations.

- CODEOWNERS define reviewers per area: Finance engineers must approve changes under `pipelines/finance/**`.  
- PR queues ensure only one publish-to-prod happens at a time, avoiding collisions.  
- Promotion flow: pipelines must first pass staging checks before being promoted to prod.  

Outcome: Teams can work independently, but governance and coordination prevent chaos.

---

### 6. Audit and Compliance

**Scenario:**  
An auditor requests proof of when the marketing enrichment logic was changed.

- Osiris provides a Git commit history showing the PR, reviewer, and deployment tag.  
- The release report includes transformation details and metrics at the time.  
- The auditor confirms compliance without digging into runtime systems.  

Outcome: Governance and compliance are streamlined thanks to Git as the system of record.

---

## Security & Compliance Architecture
