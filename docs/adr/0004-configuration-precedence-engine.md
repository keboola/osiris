# 0004 Configuration Precedence Engine

## Status
Implemented

## Context

The Osiris Pipeline requires a flexible and predictable configuration system that allows users to specify settings at multiple levels. These levels include system defaults, environment variables, user-specific configuration files, and command-line arguments. Managing these sources with a clear precedence order is essential to ensure the pipeline behaves as expected and remains easy to configure and maintain.

Without a clearly defined precedence engine, conflicting configurations can cause unpredictable behavior, making debugging difficult and reducing user confidence.

## Decision

We will implement a configuration precedence engine that merges configuration sources in the following order, from lowest to highest precedence:

1. System Defaults: Built-in default settings provided by the pipeline.
2. Environment Variables: Settings defined in the environment where the pipeline runs.
3. User Configuration Files: Configuration files located in user home directories or project directories.
4. Command-Line Arguments: Settings specified directly via the command line when invoking the pipeline.

The engine will merge these sources so that higher precedence sources override values from lower precedence sources. This merging will be done recursively to handle nested configuration structures.

The precedence engine will be implemented as a dedicated module within the pipeline, providing a clear API for loading and merging configurations. It will also validate configurations and provide meaningful error messages if conflicts or invalid values are detected.

## Consequences

- Users can customize the pipeline configuration flexibly and predictably.
- The pipeline behavior becomes easier to understand and debug due to the clear precedence rules.
- Adding new configuration sources in the future will be straightforward by extending the precedence engine.
- The engine adds complexity to the configuration loading process but provides significant benefits in maintainability and usability.
- Documentation and examples will be required to educate users about the precedence rules and configuration options.
