# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are documents that capture important decisions about the architecture and design of a project. They serve as a historical record of why certain choices were made, providing context and reasoning that help current and future contributors understand the system's evolution.

## Purpose of ADRs

The primary purpose of ADRs is to document architectural decisions clearly and concisely. This helps prevent knowledge loss, facilitates communication among team members, and supports better decision-making by providing a reference for past decisions.

## Process of Creating ADRs

1. **Identify the decision**: When a significant architectural or design decision needs to be made, create an ADR to document it.
2. **Write the ADR**: Use a clear and consistent format to describe the context, the decision itself, the alternatives considered, and the consequences.
3. **Review and Approve**: Share the ADR with the team for feedback and approval.
4. **Store and Maintain**: Save the ADR in the designated ADR directory within the project repository for easy access and future reference.

## Naming Conventions

Each ADR should have a unique identifier and a descriptive title. The recommended naming format is:

```
NNNN-title.md
```

- `NNNN` is a zero-padded sequential number (e.g., 0001, 0002).
- `title` is a short, lowercase, hyphen-separated description of the decision.

For example: `0001-use-postgresql-for-database.md`

## When to Create a New ADR

Create a new ADR whenever:

- A new architectural or design decision is made that impacts the system.
- An existing decision needs to be revised or replaced.
- Alternatives are considered, and a rationale for the chosen approach needs to be documented.

By maintaining a well-organized set of ADRs, contributors can ensure that the project's architectural history is transparent and accessible, aiding in consistent and informed development.
