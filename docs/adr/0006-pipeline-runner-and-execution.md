# ADR 0006: Pipeline Runner and Execution

## Status
Implemented

## Context
Osiris is designed to orchestrate complex workflows defined as YAML pipelines. To ensure these pipelines execute reliably and predictably, we need a dedicated component to run and manage pipeline execution. This component must handle artifact management, session logging, and support extensibility for future integrations.

Key requirements include:

- **Determinism:** Pipeline execution must be reproducible and consistent across runs.
- **Extensibility:** The system should allow integration with additional tools and services, such as e2b, in future milestones.
- **Auditability:** Detailed logs and artifacts must be preserved for traceability and debugging.

Currently, there is no unified runner that can interpret the YAML pipeline definitions, manage execution state, handle artifacts, and record session logs in a structured manner.

## Decision
We introduce a dedicated **Pipeline Runner** component within Osiris:

- The runner will parse and execute YAML pipeline definitions step-by-step.
- It will manage input and output artifacts, ensuring they are stored and versioned appropriately.
- Session logs will be captured in a structured format to provide detailed execution traces.
- The runner will expose interfaces to allow integration with external tools and services, such as e2b, enabling advanced pipeline features in future releases.
- The design will emphasize determinism by enforcing strict execution order and environment consistency.
- Extensibility will be achieved by modularizing the runner to support plugins or extensions for custom steps or integrations.
- Auditability will be ensured by preserving all artifacts and logs associated with each pipeline run.

## Consequences
- Pipeline execution becomes standardized and reliable across Osiris.
- Users gain confidence in reproducibility and traceability of pipeline runs.
- The system is prepared for future enhancements, including integration with e2b and other tools.
- Additional complexity is introduced by the runner component, requiring maintenance and testing.
- Documentation and user training will need to cover the runner's usage and capabilities.
