## 10. Q&A Guide

### Common Questions and Answers

**Q: What is this pipeline doing?**
A: It's reactivating customers who haven't purchased in 90+ days by identifying them across multiple data sources, scoring their value and churn risk, and sending targeted campaigns through Google Ads and email.

**Q: Why do we need Identity Resolution?**
A: Customers interact with us through multiple channels (website, payments, support) creating duplicate records. Identity Resolution creates a single customer view by matching these records using email, phone, and other identifiers.

**Q: What are RFM scores?**
A: Recency (when did they last buy?), Frequency (how often do they buy?), Monetary (how much do they spend?). These help identify valuable customers worth reactivating.

**Q: Why is there a schema drift warning?**
A: Mixpanel added a new field (utm_campaign) that wasn't in the original schema. It's non-breaking but should be documented to prevent future issues.

**Q: What does "84% merge rate" mean?**
A: Of all records with identifiable information, 84% were successfully matched to a customer profile. The remaining 16% couldn't be matched due to missing or inconsistent data.

**Q: Why do we have a 10% holdout?**
A: This creates a control group that doesn't receive marketing. By comparing their behavior to the marketed group, we can measure campaign effectiveness.

**Q: What's the difference between the three segments?**
A:
- **Lapsed90**: Any customer who hasn't purchased in 90+ days
- **Lapsed VIP**: High-value customers (top 10% by spend) who stopped purchasing
- **High Churn Risk**: Still active but showing warning signs (support tickets, declining engagement)

**Q: Why does Zendesk have a special connection to Feature Engineering?**
A: Support tickets are analyzed for topics (shipping delays, payment issues) which become features for predicting churn and personalizing messages.

**Q: What is Iceberg?**
A: Apache Iceberg is a modern data lake table format that provides ACID transactions, time travel, and schema evolution - essentially a versioned, reliable way to store our pipeline results.

**Q: How long does this pipeline take to run?**
A: 12 minutes for processing 2.8 million records, including all quality checks and publishing.

**Q: What happens if the pipeline fails?**
A: With checkpoint_enabled=True, it can resume from the last successful step rather than starting over.

**Q: Why are there different colors in the pipeline diagram?**
A: Colors indicate data source types: Blue (user data), Pink (financial), Purple (behavioral), Yellow (support). This helps quickly identify data categories.

**Q: What does "send_time_optimization" mean in the ESP schedule?**
A: The email system will automatically send emails at the time each recipient is most likely to open them, based on their historical engagement patterns.

**Q: Can we change the frequency cap?**
A: Yes, the 3/week limit is configurable in the activation_plan.json. It prevents customer fatigue from over-messaging.

**Q: What's the daily budget for Google Ads?**
A: $500/day as specified in the schedules section, running from Dec 19, 2024 to Jan 19, 2025.
