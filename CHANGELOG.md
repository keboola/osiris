## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.0] - 2025-10-09

**Major Release: Filesystem Contract v1 Complete**

This release completes the Filesystem Contract v1 implementation (ADR-0028), delivering a production-ready directory structure that separates build artifacts, runtime logs, and observability data. Filesystem Contract v1 provides a deterministic, reproducible filesystem layout for all Osiris runs and artifacts. All 47 commits focused on enforcing contract semantics across the entire codebase with comprehensive test coverage (1064 tests passing).

### Breaking Changes

- **Filesystem Contract v1** (ADR-0028) - **BREAKING: Legacy `./logs/**` layout completely removed**
  - **New directory structure** with clear separation of concerns:
    - `build/pipelines/[profile/]slug/hash/` - Deterministic compiled artifacts (manifest.yaml, plan.json, fingerprints.json, cfg/)
    - `run_logs/[profile/]slug/timestamp_runid/` - Per-run execution logs (events.jsonl, metrics.jsonl, artifacts/)
    - `aiop/[profile/]slug/hash/runid/` - AI Operation Packages for LLM debugging
    - `.osiris/sessions/` - Chat session state (hidden)
    - `.osiris/cache/` - Discovery cache (hidden)
    - `.osiris/index/` - Run index, latest pointers, counters (hidden)

  - **Profile support**: Enable `filesystem.profiles.enabled: true` in `osiris.yaml` to organize multi-environment workflows (dev/staging/prod)

  - **Configurable naming templates** with token rendering:
    - Manifest directories: `{manifest_short}-{manifest_hash}` (8-char prefix + full hash)
    - Run directories: `{timestamp_dt}_{timestamp_iso}_{run_id_short}_{manifest_short}`
    - AIOP paths: Support `{session_id}`, `{run_id}`, `{timestamp}` templates

  - **Run ID generation** supports multiple strategies (composable):
    - `incremental` - Simple counter (001, 002, ...)
    - `ulid` - Sortable unique IDs with timestamp prefix
    - `iso_ulid` - ISO 8601 datetime + ULID
    - `uuid4` - Random UUIDs
    - `snowflake` - Twitter Snowflake IDs

  - **Append-only run index** in `.osiris/index/runs.jsonl` for fast querying without filesystem scans

  - **Latest compile pointer** moved from `logs/.last_compile.json` to `.osiris/index/latest/{filename}.txt` (3-line format: manifest_path, manifest_hash, profile)

  - **Retention policies** for automated cleanup:
    - `run_logs/` cleanup via age-based or count-based policies
    - AIOP annex cleanup to manage large observability exports
    - CLI: `osiris maintenance clean [--dry-run]`

### Migration Notes

**⚠️ BREAKING CHANGES - No Backward Compatibility**

**Required Migration Steps:**
1. **Upgrade** to Osiris v0.4.0
2. **Update `osiris.yaml`** with filesystem configuration:
   ```yaml
   filesystem:
     base_path: "."
     build_dir: "build"
     run_logs_dir: "run_logs"
     aiop_dir: "aiop"
     profiles:
       enabled: false  # or true for multi-env
   ```
3. **Re-compile all pipelines** to populate `build/` directory
4. **Verify** artifacts appear in correct directories:
   - `build/pipelines/` - Compiled manifests
   - `run_logs/` - Execution logs
   - `aiop/` - AI observability packages
   - `.osiris/` - Hidden state
5. **Update CI/CD** to reference new paths
6. **Optional**: Commit `build/` artifacts (versionable, deterministic)

**What Changed:**
- Legacy `./logs/**` paths **completely removed** (not read or written)
- CLI commands use new contract paths exclusively
- `.last_compile.json` moved to `.osiris/index/latest/{filename}.txt`
- All sessions from v0.3.x and earlier are **not** automatically migrated
- CompilerV0 API changed: requires `fs_contract` and `pipeline_slug` parameters

**What Stays Compatible:**
- OML v0.1.0 format unchanged
- Component specs unchanged
- E2B execution fully compatible
- Configuration file structure extended (not replaced)

**References:**

### Tests
- 11 new cases in `tests/core/test_validation_connections.py`.

### Notes
- Backward compatible; NO-SECRETS posture preserved.

**Major Release: Milestone M2a Complete - AI Operation Package (AIOP)**

This release completes Milestone M2a, delivering a comprehensive, production-ready AI Operation Package (AIOP) system. AIOP provides a four-layer semantic architecture (Evidence, Semantic, Narrative, Metadata) that enables any LLM to fully understand Osiris pipeline runs through structured, deterministic, secret-free exports. All 24 acceptance criteria met with 921 tests passing.

### Added

  - Annex policy for large runs with NDJSON shards (.aiop-annex/)
  - Automatic secret redaction with DSN masking (postgres://user:***@host/db)
  - Rich progress indicators during export
  - Exit code 4 for truncated exports

  - Effective config tracking in `metadata.config_effective` with per-key source
  - Auto-export after every run with templated paths and retention policies

- **Evidence Layer** (PR1-PR2)
  - Timeline with chronological events and configurable density (low/medium/high)
  - Metrics aggregation with step-level and total statistics
  - Error collection with stack traces and context
  - Artifact tracking with SHA-256 hashes and sizes

### Fixed
- **Test Stability**
  - Fixed AIOP tests failing due to truncation by increasing max-core-bytes limit

**Major Release: Milestone M1 - Component Registry and Runner**

This release represents a complete architectural overhaul with the implementation of the Component Registry system, unified runtime, E2B Transparent Proxy, and comprehensive tooling for data engineers. The system now provides full parity between local and E2B execution with production-ready logging, validation, and error handling.

### Upgrade notes
- **Breaking**: Supabase writers now require `key` field (was optional). **Action**: Add `key` to Supabase connection config.
- **Deprecated**: `load` mode → use `write`. **Action**: Update OML/manifests accordingly.
- **Note**: ExecutionAdapter interface stabilized; remove any custom references to deleted legacy E2B classes (E2BPack, PayloadBuilder).
- If you parse logs programmatically, prefer `cleanup_complete.total_rows` as source of truth for totals.
