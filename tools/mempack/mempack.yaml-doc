  Osiris – active milestone M1c (feature/m1c). Prioritize compiler+runner + chat flow fixes.
  Pack only deterministic, review-friendly sources. No secrets / no heavy logs / no run artifacts.

include:
# Core src
- docs/**
# Note: Most other exclusions are now handled by .gitignore:
# - testing_env/ artifacts (handled by .gitignore)
# - output/ directories (handled by .gitignore)
# - compiled/ and _artifacts/ (handled by .gitignore)
# - mempack.txt itself (handled by .gitignore)

# Also embed a fresh project tree (so I can see structure at-a-glance)
embed_tree: false

# Automatically exclude files/dirs from .gitignore
# When true, patterns from .gitignore are applied before explicit excludes
# Include patterns can override gitignore/exclude patterns (include wins)
use_gitignore: false

# Safety: cap the size so we don't over-feed the model by accident
