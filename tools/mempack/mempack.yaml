  Osiris – active milestone M1c. Prioritize compiler+runner work.
  This pack should be deterministic and safe to share (no secrets).

# Include files (globs are allowed). They’ll be expanded, sorted, and packed.
include:
- docs/adr/*.md
- docs/milestones/*.md
- docs/roadmap/*.md
- osiris/cli/*.py
- osiris/core/*.py
- osiris/components/*.py
- osiris/connectors/**/**/*.py
- tests/**/**/*.py
- components/spec.schema.json
- components/*/**/spec.yaml
- pyproject.toml
- osiris.py
- requirements.txt

# Exclude patterns (applied after include)
exclude:
- "**/__pycache__/**"
- "**/*.pyc"
- "testing_env/**"
- "tmp/**"
- ".git/**"
- "osiris_pipeline.egg-info/**"
- "uv.lock"

# Also embed a fresh project tree (so I can see structure at-a-glance)
embed_tree: true

# Safety: stop if the packed file would exceed this many bytes (0 = unlimited)
max_bytes: 0
